; MINIMAX procedures
;---------------------------------------------------------------------------

; Minimax launch the evaluation of the current state... and reports the 
; successor that reaches the maximum.
; #visible? (bool) will determine if the process produces visibal changes (colors and labels)
; or not
to-report minimax [s #visible?]
  let res nobody
  ask s [
    let evaluation (eval #visible?) 
    if #visible? [set label last evaluation]
    set res first evaluation
  ]
  report res
end

; Eval function is the core of MINIMAX.
; We compute for every state a pair [successor fitness] that reports the evaluation
; of the state (min or max of fitness of successors) and one of the successors where
; this extreme is reached
to-report eval [ #visible? ]
  ; If it is a leaf state, we report the fitness stored in the state
  ifelse leaf?
  [ if #visible? [set label fitness]
    report (list self fitness)
  ]
  ; If not, we compute maximum or minimum (it depends if the player will play or the opponent)
  ; of the evaluation of successors
  [ let selected nobody
    ifelse player = "me"
    [ set selected max-one-of legal-successors [last (eval #visible?)] ]
    [ set selected min-one-of legal-successors [last (eval #visible?)] ]
    if #visible? [
      ask legal-move-to selected [
        set color blue
        set thickness .2
      ]
      set label [last (eval #visible?)] of selected
    ]
    report (list selected [last (eval #visible?)] of selected)

; Report for getting the legal successors of this state (it depends on the problem we are solving,
; in this simple case it is only the successors in the graph)

; Report for getting the legal move to reach state s' from the current one (it depends on the
; problem we are solving, in this simple case it is only the link connecting them)
